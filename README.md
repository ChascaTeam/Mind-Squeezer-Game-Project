## Game explanation:

The game asks question and waits current amount of time. If the player doesn’t give an answer or gives a wrong one the game ends,
if the player gives correct answer the game rewards him with points and after few answered questions – with levels. Every level 
lowers the time for answering. The game continues until the player makes mistake. After that the game calculates the score, 
compares it to the top 3 scores, made in the game, and if the player achieved better one, gives him the opportunity to write his
name in the top 3. There are four types of questions in the game and each one have different time for answering, and tickles
different part of the brain.

#### First type:
Color Guesser – gives colored word, and asks the player to type the color of the word.
The catch is that the word is always a color and the time is very short.

#### Second type: 
Find The Word – gives a matrix with chars, and asks the player to find the hidden four or five letter word.
The catch is that the word can be in any direction and positon. The given time is moderate.

#### Third type:
Math Matrix – gives equation and a matrix with coordinates and digits, and asks the player to write the coordinate
of the equation answer. Here the player can have several correct answers. The given time is moderate.

#### Fourth type: 
Unwrap The Sentence – gives matrix with a wrapped sentence in it. The player has to find the start of the sentence 
and write it in the answer field. The given time is high.
